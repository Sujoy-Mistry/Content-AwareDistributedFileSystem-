# Content-Aware Distributed File System Architecture

## Overview

This architecture outlines a content-aware distributed file system that splits files into chunks, places them across multiple nodes, and uses content analysis (NLP and Magic Byte Matching) to classify and serve files. It also supports **dynamic data redistribution**, **replication**, and **fault tolerance**.

### 1. **File Chunking and Upload Service**

- **Client** uploads files to the system.
- Files are split into **chunks**.
- Each chunk is uploaded to the **Upload Service**.
- Chunks are distributed across **multiple nodes** based on a load-balancing algorithm.

### 2. **Content-Aware Classification Service**

- The **Content Analysis Service** classifies the files based on their **content type**:
    - Uses **NLP** for text-based files.
    - Uses **Magic Byte Matching** for binary files (PDF, image, etc.).
- The classification helps determine whether the file needs special handling (e.g., large media files like videos, images, or specific metadata analysis).

### 3. **Chunk Placement and Node Allocation**

- Files are divided into chunks (e.g., **Chunk 1**, **Chunk 2**, **Chunk 3**, etc.).
- **Node Allocation**: Nodes can be categorized into **fast nodes** (for frequently accessed chunks) and **regular nodes** (for standard storage).
- The chunks are distributed based on the node's speed and available capacity. Some chunks may be replicated on multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### 4. **Metadata Storage**

- A **centralized metadata service** (using technologies like **Zookeeper** or **etcd**) stores:
    - **Chunk Locations**: The metadata service tracks where each chunk resides.
    - **Node Availability**: Information about which nodes are up and running.
    - **File Information**: File details such as name, type, content metadata, and chunking information.
- This service is queried to get locations of chunks during file retrieval.

### 5. **Fault Tolerance and Replication**

- Each chunk is **replicated** across multiple nodes to prevent data loss. If a chunk is requested from a failed node, it can be fetched from another replica.
- **Replication Factor**: Configure the system to keep 2-3 replicas of each chunk.
- **Node Failover**: If a node fails, the system re-routes requests to healthy replicas. The failed node’s chunks are re-replicated to another node to maintain the replication factor.

### 6. **Content-Aware Optimization (Dynamic Data Distribution)**

- **Frequently accessed files** or **chunks** are moved to **faster nodes** based on access frequency.
- The system tracks the **access count** for each chunk and decides which chunks should be moved to faster nodes.
- **Data Redistribution**:
    - Chunks with lower access frequency can be moved to slower nodes to free up space on faster nodes.
    - Chunks with higher access frequency are dynamically moved to faster nodes to improve retrieval speed.

### 7. **Client Access and File Retrieval**

- **Client Request**: A client requests a file by its ID or name.
- The **metadata service** identifies the chunks associated with the requested file.
- The client is then directed to the nodes where the chunks are stored.
    - If a chunk is on a faster node, it is retrieved quickly.
    - If the chunk is on a slower node, the system can try to fetch it from another replica (if available).

### 8. **Monitoring and System Health**

- The system includes a **monitoring service** that tracks:
    - **Node health**: Whether each node is up and running.
    - **Chunk access frequency**: To trigger dynamic data redistribution and optimize file retrieval.
    - **Replicas**: Ensures that chunks are sufficiently replicated across nodes and handles re-replication if a node goes down.
- Alerts and notifications are triggered if a node fails, and automatic rebalancing is initiated.

## Detailed Component Architecture

### **Client**
- Interface for users to upload and retrieve files.

### **Upload Service**
- **Chunk Files**: Split files into smaller chunks.
- **Distribute Chunks**: Distribute chunks across available nodes.
  
### **Content Analysis Service**
- Classifies files using NLP and Magic Byte Matching.
- Helps decide which node to place the file (e.g., text files on fast nodes, large files on regular nodes).

### **Metadata Service**
- Stores information about chunk locations, file metadata, and node status.

### **Nodes**
- **Fast Nodes**: Store chunks that are accessed frequently.
- **Regular Nodes**: Store chunks that are less frequently accessed.

### **Fault Tolerance Mechanism**
- **Replication**: Each chunk is replicated on at least 2 nodes to ensure fault tolerance.
- **Automatic Rebalancing**: If a node goes down, chunks are re-replicated across healthy nodes.
  
### **Monitoring and Analytics Service**
- Tracks node status and chunk access frequency.
- Triggers rebalancing and dynamic data migration when needed.

## Example Flow (Upload and Retrieval)

### Upload Flow:
1. **Client Uploads File**: The file is uploaded to the system.
2. **Chunking**: The file is split into smaller chunks.
3. **Content Classification**: The content is analyzed (using NLP or Magic Byte Matching).
4. **Chunk Distribution**: Chunks are placed across different nodes, based on load and node types (fast vs regular).
5. **Replication**: Chunks are replicated across multiple nodes to ensure fault tolerance.

### Retrieval Flow:
1. **Client Requests File**: The client requests a file by ID.
2. **Metadata Query**: The system checks the metadata service for the locations of the chunks.
3. **Chunk Retrieval**: The system retrieves chunks from the appropriate nodes.
4. **Dynamic Node Selection**: If the chunk is on a fast node, it’s retrieved quickly. If it’s on a regular node, the system may check for availability on replicas.
5. **File Reassembly**: The chunks are reassembled into the original file.

## Scalability and Extensibility

- **Scaling Nodes**: The system can scale by adding more nodes to the cluster.
- **Dynamic Data Redistribution**: Based on access patterns, chunks are moved between fast and regular nodes.
- **Cloud Integration**: This system can be deployed on top of cloud infrastructure like AWS, GCP, or Azure, leveraging distributed storage services for nodes and replicas.
